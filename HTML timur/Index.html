                <p style="color:blueviolet"> Kinetic energy is present in moving automobiles owing to their mass and velocity.
            A moving vehicle of a larger size will have more kinetic energy than the one with a smaller mass,
             because mass of the moving object is a proportional factor in the formula of kinetic energy.<p>

            <h1 align="center"style="color:blue">Potential energy<h1>
                <h2 title="it's an explanation of Potential_energy">In physics, potential energy is the energy held by an object because of its position relative to other objects,
                     stresses within itself, its electric charge, or other factors.The term potential energy was introduced by the 19th-century Scottish engineer and physicist William Ranking,
                    although it has links to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle's concept of potentiality.<h2>
